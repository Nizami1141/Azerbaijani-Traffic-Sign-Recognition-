# Azerbaijani Traffic Sign Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing Azerbaijani traffic signs using a deep learning model. The dataset includes various traffic signs commonly found on Azerbaijani roads, and the model is trained to detect and classify these signs using the YOLOv8 model accurately.

## Introduction

This project aims to build a robust model for traffic sign recognition to assist in autonomous driving and traffic management systems. The model leverages the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and image classification.

## Features

- Detection and classification of Azerbaijani traffic signs
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization
- Model evaluation with detailed metrics
