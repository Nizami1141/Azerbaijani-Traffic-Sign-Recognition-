## Introduction

This project aims to build a robust model for traffic sign recognition to assist in autonomous driving and traffic management systems. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.

## Features

- Detection and classification of Azerbaijani traffic signs
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization
- Model evaluation with detailed metrics
