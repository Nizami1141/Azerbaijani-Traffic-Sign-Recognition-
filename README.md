# Azerbaijani Traffic Sign Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing Azerbaijani traffic signs using a deep learning model. The dataset includes various traffic signs commonly found on Azerbaijani roads, and the model is trained to detect and classify these signs using the YOLOv8 model accurately.

## Introduction

This project aims to build a robust model for traffic sign recognition to assist in autonomous driving and traffic management systems. The model leverages the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and image classification.

## Features

- Detection and classification of Azerbaijani traffic signs
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization
- Model evaluation with detailed metrics

## Dataset

## Future Work
Future work includes:

Expanding the dataset with more diverse traffic signs
Improving the model's accuracy and robustness
Implementing real-time traffic sign recognition

## Recommendation

If you have a low-spec computer or have concerns about using the code Iâ€™ve committed, I will provide a version compatible with Google Colab. You can run the code in a cloud-based environment without worrying about your local machine's performance.
